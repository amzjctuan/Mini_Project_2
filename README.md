2018 Fall - Boston University - EC601 #project_2

1. Load Data: 
   Put two catergories into "PetImages Folder" and add two folders for differnt catergories.
   
2. Train Data:
   Use CNN algorithm for training data.
   Ajust the "epoch" number for how many iterations to train for the data.
   The bigger the number the more accurate the outcome but it takes longer time as well.
   
3. Test Data:
   Put one of the test image under the repository and type the name of the image in the command line.

# System Environment 

- Python 3.6.5
 
# Program Description

There are three functions made in the Train_data.py.
- Load data
- Train data
- Test Data

You need to type the image you wanna detect from the catergories you have set.
Then, it will automatically help you to clarify which type of the image you have.
